# Attrition-Insights-Building-a-Resilient-Workforce-at-Innov8-Using-Tableau
Innov8, a leading Health technology company with close to 1500 employees, is facing a significant challenge with an attrition rate of 16%. Out of its workforce, 243 employees have resigned, impacting the company's productivity and stability.

As a data analyst contracted by Innov8, I was tasked with analyzing the HR Attrition dataset to identify factors contributing to attrition and develop strategies to reduce it.

Through comprehensive analysis, several key insights were uncovered:

The highest attrition rates were observed among employees aged 30-35 and 24-29, with a decline in attrition for employees aged 36 to 60.

The Research and Development department had the highest attrition count, followed by the Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive roles.

Employees who travel frequently, those with lower education levels (between 1 and 3), and those in the Low and Middle Income Group showed higher attrition rates.

Attrition was higher among single employees compared to married ones.

Based on these insights, the following recommendations were formulated to address the attrition challenge:

Implement targeted retention programs focusing on the career aspirations of employees aged 30-35 and 24-29.

Provide clear career development paths, mentorship programs, and training opportunities, especially for employees aged 36 to 60.

Develop department-specific retention strategies, particularly for the Research and Development department.

Tailor retention strategies for roles with high attrition rates, such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.

Implement measures to reduce frequent travel and offer work-life balance initiatives.

Provide support for further education and skill development, particularly for employees with lower education levels.

Customize benefits packages to meet the needs of different demographic groups, focusing on single employees and those in the Low and Middle Income Group.

Implement regular engagement sessions and employee feedback mechanisms to monitor satisfaction levels and identify potential issues.

By implementing these targeted strategies, Innov8 aims to reduce employee attrition, increase satisfaction, and build a more engaged and stable workforce, ensuring sustained productivity and growth.
